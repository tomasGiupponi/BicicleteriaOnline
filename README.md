This part of the project includes the backend using NestJS and the frontend using NextJS.<br>
The principal idea of this is create a page for a bicycle store, where the owner can upload, delete or edit his products (this case everything in relation with bicycles).
If you investigate a little my project, it is a CRUD, only does basics things for the moment and Im working on the frontend.<br>
To make it "easier" for me, remember this is for practice, Im using prisma ORM and SQlite. There is a very interesting and useful extension in VSCode called "Thunder Client", I use it in the project to test the API. Also I use swagger for document and test the API.<br>
About the frontend, Im using shadcn for the differents components implemented in the project and make things easier.
