This part of the project only includes the backend using NestJS.
The principal idea of this is create a page for a bicycle store, where the owner can upload, delete or edit his products (this case everything in relation with bicycles).
If you investigate a little my project, it is a CRUD, only does basics things for the moment and Im working on the frontend.
